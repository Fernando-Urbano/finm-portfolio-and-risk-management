### 1.1.
- (5/5) Said that it is the size factor (SMB)
- (2/5) Said that the value factor (HML) - while the answer is not the required one, the value factor has had a decrease in risk-premium. It is still a valuable factor due to its low correlation with the market.
- (3/5) Said that it is the value factor (HML) and explained the reasoning.
- (0/5) Said that it is Market (MKT), or Momentum (UMD)

### 1.2
For MAE of cross-sectional:

- (2.5/2.5) Said that MAE will decrease for sure and explained what the MAE is in the cross-sectional.
- (2.5/2.5) Said that MAE will ONLY not decrease in case the factor is a linear combination of the other factors available, and explained what MAE is.
- (1.0/2.5) Said that the MAE will decrease for sure but did not give any explanation as to why.
- (1.5/2.5) Said that the MAE will NOT decrease for sure, but gave a good explanation of what is the MAE in the cross-sectional.
- (0/0) Said that the MAE will NOT decrease for sure and gave a poor explanation of what is the MAE in the cross-sectional.

**Reminder:**
MAE in the cross-sectional is the average absolute error of the regression.

For MAE of time-series:

- (2.5/2.5) Said that MAE will NOT decrease for sure and explained what is the MAE in the time-series.
- (1.0/2.5) Said that the MAE will NOT decrease for sure but did not give any explanation as to why.
- (1.5/2.5) Said that the MAE will decrease for sure, but gave a good explanation of what the MAE is in the time-series.
- (0/0) Said that the MAE will decrease for sure and gave a poor explanation of what the MAE is in the time-series.

**Reminder:**
MAE in the time-series is the average absolute value of the $\alpha_i$ (intercept) in the time-series regression.

### 1.3
- (5/5) Said that we are more certain about the cumulative returns of the elderly person and explained that the main reason is due to the linear increase in the variance of the cumulative returns as "h" increases.
- (2.5/5) Said that we are more certain about the cumulative returns of the elderly person but did not give a good or correct reason.
- (1/5) Said that we are more certain about the cumulative returns of younger persons and explained that, as the sample size increases, we are more certain about an estimation.
- (0/0) Said that we are more certain about the cumulative returns of the younger person and did not give any valid reason.

### 1.4
- (5/5) Said that `YLD` model can be tested in the cross-sectional only and `FFYLD` can be tested in the cross-sectional and the time-series. Explained that the `YLD` is not testable in the time-series because it is a non-tradable asset (possibly gave the example of CCAPM, but not required).
- (3.5/5) Said that `YLD` model can be tested in the cross-sectional only and `FFYLD` can be tested in the cross-sectional and the time-series. Did not explain why or gave a poor explanation.
- (1/5) Said that both models can be tested in the cross-sectional and time-series format. 
- (1/5) Said that both models can be tested only in time-series format.
- (1/5) Said that both models can be tested only in cross-sectional format. 
- (3/5) Said that `FFYLD` model can be tested in the cross-sectional only and `YLD` can be tested in the cross-sectional and the time-series. Explained correctly the reasoning but got confused regarding which assets are tradable.
- (1/5) Said that `FFYLD` model can be tested in the cross-sectional only and `YLD` can be tested in the cross-sectional and the time-series. Did not explain why or gave a poor explanation.
- (0/5) Did not mention the existence of the cross-sectional and time-series tests.

### 1.5
- (5/5)
 Mentioned 3 out of 4 bullet points of the solution AND did not say anything wrong.
- (4/5)
    - Mentioned 3 out of 4 bullet points of the solution BUT said 1 thing wrong (or out of context).
    - Mentioned 2 out of 4 bullet points of the solution AND did not say anything wrong.
- (2/5)
    - Mentioned 3 out of 4 bullet points of the solution BUT said 2 things wrong (or out of context).
    - Mentioned 2 out of 4 bullet points of the solution BUT said 1 thing wrong (or out of context).
    - Mentioned 1 out of 4 bullet points of the solution AND did not say anything wrong.
- (1/5)
    - Mentioned 1 out of 4 bullet points of the solution BUT said 1 thing wrong (or out of context).
- (0/0)
    - Any other situation.

## 2.5
- (5/5) Said that the factor model performs better and gave good reasoning regarding it being able to capture systematic risk.
- (+1) Mentioned one of the "extras" in the solution (not transferable to other questions).
- (+2) Mentioned both "extras" in the solution (not transferable to other questions).
- (-1) Mentioned that the pricing factor model is a perfect pricing model due to the result (not transferable to other questions).
- (1.5/5) Mentioned that the factor-based model performs better but gave bad reason or explained poorly.
- (3/5) Mentioned that the historical-based model performs better (which is wrong), but mentioned that, in such cases, the factor model is not correctly capturing the systematic risk.
- (0/5) Mentioned that the historical-based model performs better and gave a poor explanation.

## 2.7
- (3.5/5) Said that the ETF-based tangency portfolio is better and explained that the tangency portfolio with factors performs significantly worse than the ETF-based tangency is evidence that the AQR pricing factor model is probably not a perfect pricing model.
- (+1.5) Explained that, if the factor model was the perfect pricing factor model, the tangency with the factors would be the best investment since it captures all risk-premia (not transferable to other questions).
- (1/5) Said that the factor-based tangency portfolio is better, but also mentioned that the AQR factor pricing model is not perfect.
- (2/5) Said that the factor-based tangency is the best considering if you consider the beliefs of the firm.
- (0/0) Said that the factor-based tangency portfolio is better and did not mention that the AQR factor pricing model is not perfect.
